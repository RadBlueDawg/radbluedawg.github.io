title:  "Dicer: Mass d6 Roller"
---
Dicer is a quick little app I threw together to help out my friends at Purdue’s Superheroes of Science. They came to me needing a way to embed a dice roller for their [virtual lab on half-lives](https://www.purdue.edu/science/K12/LabPages/nuclear/radiocarbon_dating.html), and luckily I was itching for some experience with both Godot and web embeds.

Dicer lets you roll between 1 and 100 six-sided dice. By request, since the students are supposed to manually check the values of each die, the app does nothing beyond that. And that’s it, quick and simple. The core functionality only took me a couple of hours to put together. I spent more time trying to make everything look pretty.

For the actual rolling animation and result display, I used icons from [Game-icons.net](https://game-icons.net/). I love using that site for icons, and was lucky to find they had both face view and perspective view icons for six-sided dice. The face views were used for the result indicators, and the perspective views came in handy for the rolling animation.

I’m actually quite proud of how the rolling animation came out, for as simple as it is. The dice go through the perspective icons sequentially. For individual dice, the faces change quickly enough that it’s hard to tell. However, the illusion starts to break down when you have multiple dice rolling at once. To fix that, I had each dice randomly pick which perspective icon to start with. 

You can take a look at the final output on [Dicer’s Itch.io page](https://radbluedawg.itch.io/dicer) and dig into the source code on [my GitHub](https://github.com/RadBlueDawg/Dicer).
