I'm Steven, I'm a programmer professionally and I dabble with game design in my free time. I'm also really bad at writing about myself. This blurb is something I'll update eventually to be a bit meatier. I should probably also update that default profile picture to something else.

This website has a blog and a project showcase section. The project showcase I'm reserving for big things, and since I don't have anything at the moment that I'd qualify under that it's only got the default pages in there. The blog section is where I'll detail smaller projects that aren't quite showcase worthy, or other things that catch my interest. We'll see!
